# Debug Vibrations - Testing Project

This repository is a simple testing project for video coding demonstrations and showcasing the capabilities of agentic Claude 3.7 AI assistant.

## Project Overview

Debug Vibrations is a Flutter application that allows testing vibration patterns through sound simulation. It was developed with the assistance of Claude 3.7, demonstrating how AI can help in coding tasks.

## Features

- Web-based vibration testing through sound simulation
- Multiple vibration patterns and presets
- Amplitude control for vibration intensity
- Different sound types to simulate various vibration feelings
- Cross-platform compatibility (web focus)

## Technical Details

- Built with Flutter
- Uses Web Audio API for sound generation
- Custom implementation for web vibration simulation
- Responsive UI design

## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of:
1. AI-assisted coding with Claude 3.7
2. Flutter web development
3. Audio API implementation
4. Cross-platform considerations in mobile development

## Getting Started

To run this project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd DebugVibrations

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the web version
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Acknowledgements

This project was created with the assistance of Claude 3.7, an AI assistant by Anthropic, to demonstrate agentic capabilities in coding tasks.
